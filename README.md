TopShelf.OldLog4NetIntegration
==============================

Integrates TopShelft with the popular older version of log4net 1.2.10.  

The current version of TopShelf requires >= 1.2.11, which may be a problem for if you are using
other libraries (such as Castle log4net) that are not compatible with the newer versions.

There is a nuget package at https://nuget.org/packages/TopShelf.OldLog4NetIntegration/.
